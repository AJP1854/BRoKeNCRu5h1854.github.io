### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was an interesting experience and an opening to the world of coding for me. I was fascinated with physics of what coding truly is and even as simple as creating the text "Hello World". Will forever like the first code I ever worked on.

* Lab 10

    lab 10 was an interesting lab because it dealt with prime numbers. It was difficult to do but I enjoy my group and our effort to get the lab done. Unfortunately we didn't complete it to it's entirity but it was a great experience to work on.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was the final lab that we did and i thought it was the lab I did the best on. I believe while each lab was a learning experience, this was the lab I learned the most about. I also really enjoy the gif portion of the lab.
